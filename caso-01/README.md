# Case Study 01: Investigating a Suspicious Website

### Objective
To determine whether the fictitious website `login-seguro-banco.com` is legitimate or a phishing attempt, using only free online tools.

### Tools Used
* Google
* ViewDNS.info (an online tool that gathers various information)

### Investigation Steps
1. **Starting Point:** I received the suspicious link `login-seguro-banco.com`.

2. **Initial Analysis (Whois):** I used the "Whois" tool on the ViewDNS.info website to see who registered the domain. The search showed that it was registered only two days ago and the owner's name was hidden by a privacy service. This is already a red flag.

3. **IP Analysis:** On the same website, I used the "IP History" tool to view the server's IP address history. I discovered that this same IP has hosted five other websites in the past, and two of them had names related to scams (e.g., `ganhe-dinheiro-facil.net`).

4. **Google Search:** I typed the website name into Google in quotation marks (`"login-seguro-banco.com"`). I didn't find any reference to it on the official website of any well-known bank, which indicates that it is not a legitimate page.

### Findings
* The domain was recently registered anonymously.
* The server hosting the website has a history of hosting other malicious websites.
* The website has no affiliation with any real banking institutions.

### Conclusion
The website `login-seguro-banco.com` is **highly suspicious** and has all the characteristics of a phishing page created to steal passwords. The investigation, although simple, confirmed that the website should be avoided and reported.
